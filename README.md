# ðŸ’» Digital Image Processing - Practices

# The college subject

This respository contains some practices made on Digital Signal
Processing classes. In this subject, I studied how to decompose 
digital signals and apply transformations, additionaly using 
filters. 

# The practices subjects

1. Signal Components
2. Convolutional Operator and Low Pass Filters
3. Gaussian and Derivative Filters
4. DFT and IDFT (Discrete Fourier Transform and Inverse DFT)
5. Matrix DFT
6. DFT and IDFT with "for loops"
7. Gabor Filters - Frequency domain
8. Gabor Filters - Space domain
9. FIR FIlters

# How to run

Just open a jupyter notebook to see all the .ipynb files.
